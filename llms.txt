> "Know Your Net Worth. Master Your Wealth."

## Project Summary
Safelyo is an offline-first wealth tracking application designed for privacy-conscious investors. It allows users to consolidate all assets—cryptocurrency (including cold wallets), stocks, real estate, and cash—into a single dashboard without ever sending sensitive financial data to the cloud. All data is stored locally on the user's device. The app uses AI (Gemini, OpenAI, Perplexity) responsibly to provide real-time asset valuations and insights, with strict data anonymization protocols.
